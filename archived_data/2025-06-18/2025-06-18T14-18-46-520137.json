  "content": "Spain blames April blackout on grid failures and poor planning, not a cyberattack: As the jury continues deliberating Wednesday in Karen Read\u2019s second murder trial, they are weighing three separate charges brought against her by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.The first charge, second-degree murder, is the most serious charge, and if convicted, Read could face life in prison, with the possibility of parole after a minimum of 15 years.The second charge, manslaughter while operating a motor vehicle under the influence of liquor, alleges that Read was driving drunk when she hit and killed John O\u2019Keefe with her SUV. That charge carries a minimum mandatory prison sentence of five years and a maximum of 20 years, plus a fine of up to $25,000 and a license suspension of at least 15 years and potentially for life.The third charge, leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death, alleges that Read left the scene after hitting O\u2019Keefe without providing any assistance or reporting the incident. That carries a mandatory minimum sentence of one year in jail or 2.5 years in state prison, plus fines between $1,000-5,000 and a mandatory license suspension of at least three years.Read, 45, is accused of fatally striking O\u2019Keefe, her Boston police officer boyfriend, with her SUV and leaving him to die in the snow outside a house party where other local police and a federal agent were closing out a night of drinking in 2022. Read\u2019s lawyers say O\u2019Keefe, 46, was beaten, bitten by a dog, then left outside a home in Canton in a conspiracy orchestrated by the police that included planting evidence against Read.",
